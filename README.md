# Platform Agnostic

This is a set of multi-platform libraries that allows you to use familiar annotations from Android in common code for other platforms.

There is no magic here, mostly stubs/wrappers

# Tasks to-do (Roadmap):

- [ ] Add more annotations, interfaces and classes which could be used on with KMP/KMM
- [ ] Publish to JitPack
